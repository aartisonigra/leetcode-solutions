PROBLEAMS:

You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [li, ri].

For each queries[i]:

Select a subset of indices within the range [li, ri] in nums.
Decrement the values at the selected indices by 1.
A Zero Array is an array where all elements are equal to 0.

Return true if it is possible to transform nums into a Zero Array after processing all the queries sequentially, otherwise return false.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,1], queries = [[0,2]]

Output: true

Explanation:

For i = 0:
Select the subset of indices as [0, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3],[0,2]]

Output: false

Explanation:

For i = 0:
Select the subset of indices as [1, 2, 3] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [4, 2, 1, 0].
For i = 1:
Select the subset of indices as [0, 1, 2] and decrement the values at these indices by 1.
The array will become [3, 1, 0, 0], which is not a Zero Array.

SOUTIONS:

class Solution {

    public boolean isZeroArray(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int[] deltaArray = new int[nums.length + 1];
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int left = query[0];
            int right = query[1];
            deltaArray[left] += 1;
            deltaArray[right + 1] -= 1;
        }
        int[] operationCounts = new int[deltaArray.length];
        int currentOperations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < deltaArray.length; i++) {
            currentOperations += deltaArray[i];
            operationCounts[i] = currentOperations;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (operationCounts[i] < nums[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
